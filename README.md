## SWOT Analysis:
  - Strengths: I'm skilled in figuring out complex logic and doing research.
  - Weaknesses: I'm not as comfortable in React as I am in vanilla JavaScript.
  - Opportunities: I have a good opportunity to learn more about React and what I'm able to do with it.
  - Threats: Airtable may not work the way I want it to. React has some rules that make it hard to work with without beingmore familiar with the framework.
